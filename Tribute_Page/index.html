            Dhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at Trimbak, Bombay Presidency into a Marathi-speaking
            Chitpavan Brahmin family. His father, Govind Sadashiv Phalke alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit
            scholar and worked as a Hindu priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a
            housewife. The couple had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Shivrampant, the eldest, was
            twelve years elder than Phalke and worked in Baroda. He briefly worked as the Dewan (Chief
            Administrator) of the princely state of Jawhar and died in 1921, at the age of 63. Phalke's second
            brother, Raghunathrao, also worked as a priest and died at a young age of 21. Dajishastri taught Phalke
            to conduct religious rituals like yajna and dispensing of medicines. When he was appointed as a
            professor of Sanskrit in the Wilson College, Bombay, the family shifted its base to Bombay. Phalke
            completed his primary education in Trimbakeshwar and matriculation was done in Bombay.

            After coming back from London, Phalke started looking for a spacious place for shooting the films. Soon, the
            family shifted from Ismail Building, Charni Road to Mathura Bhavan Bungalow, Dadar. He constructed a
            small glass room at the compound of the bungalow and prepared a dark room and arrangements for processing
            the film. Imported filmmaking equipment reached Bombay in May 1912 and Phalke set it up within four days
            with the help of sketch provided. He also taught his family to perforate and develop the film. To test the
            working of camera and projector, Phalke filmed the boys and girls in the surroundings to the satisfactory
            results. To demonstrate the filmmaking techniques and get financier for the feature film, Phalke
            decided to make a short film. He planted some peas in a pot and placed a camera in front of it. He shot one
            frame a day for over a month producing a film just over one minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and
            changing into a climber. The short film titled Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) and showed selective
            individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.
